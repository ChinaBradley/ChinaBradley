### Hi, I'm China ðŸ‘‹,

An aspiring data analyst with a passion for working with data to gain insights and drive business decisions. After realizing my interest in data analytics, I decided to make a career change and have been teaching myself various skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau to better understand and analyze data. Through building projects, I have gained experience in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and storytelling.

I am a self-motivated learner who is constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to develop my skills. I am excited to contribute my data analytical skills to companies and organizations that value data-driven decision-making.

When I'm not analyzing data, you can find me exploring the outdoors, reading books, or suffering through the English Premier League season while supporting my favorite team.
